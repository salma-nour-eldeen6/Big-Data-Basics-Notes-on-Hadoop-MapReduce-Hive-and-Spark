# Big Data Basics: Comprehensive Notes on Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, and Spark

This repository contains detailed educational notes covering fundamental concepts and technologies in Big Data ecosystems. The material is structured as a 93-page PDF derived from lecture notes, offering clear explanations, comparisons, and practical examples.

## Key Topics Covered:
- **Core Hadoop Ecosystem**  
  HDFS architecture, YARN resource management, and Hadoop 1 vs. Hadoop 2 differences.
- **Processing Frameworks**  
  In-depth comparisons of MapReduce, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink (execution models, latency, use cases).
- **Data Processing**  
  Batch vs. real-time processing, HiveQL, partitioning/bucketing, and ACID transactions in Hive.
- **Storage Formats**  
  Structured vs. unstructured data, schema-on-read vs. schema-on-write, ORC/Parquet optimizations.
- **Advanced Concepts**  
  RDD transformations/actions in Spark, broadcast variables, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Performance Optimization**  
  Data locality, shuffle operations, and execution engines (Tez, Spark, MapReduce).
